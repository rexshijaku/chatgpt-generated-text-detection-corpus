As a language model, I am programmed to provide information and generate responses, but I do not have personal beliefs or opinions. However, I can certainly present arguments for and against the statement "People should read only those books that are about real events, real people, and established facts."
One argument in favor of this statement is that reading about real events, real people, and established facts can be educational and informative. Books that are based on true events can provide insight into historical or current events and give a deeper understanding of the world around us. Similarly, biographies and non-fiction works can offer a glimpse into the lives and experiences of real people and can be inspiring or thought-provoking. Reading books that are based on established facts can also help us learn new things and expand our knowledge base.
On the other hand, there are also valid arguments against this statement. Fiction, for example, can be just as educational and informative as non-fiction. Many fictional works are based on real events or are inspired by real people, but they often take creative liberties in order to tell a compelling story. Additionally, fiction can be a powerful tool for exploring and examining complex ideas, emotions, and social issues in a way that is not always possible with non-fiction. Fiction can also serve as a means of escapism and entertainment, which can be important for mental health and well-being.
In conclusion, whether or not people should read only books that are about real events, real people, and established facts is a matter of personal preference and depends on an individual's goals and interests. While there are certainly benefits to reading non-fiction and books based on real events, there are also many benefits to reading fiction and other imaginative works. Ultimately, the important thing is that people have the opportunity to read a diverse range of books and have the freedom to choose what they read.
