There is a debate over whether university students should be required to attend classes or if it should be optional for them. While both sides have valid arguments, I believe that university students should be required to attend classes.
One argument for making attendance optional is that students are adults and should have the freedom to make their own decisions about their education. They may prefer to learn on their own or through other methods, such as online coursework. Furthermore, some students may have work or other commitments that prevent them from attending classes regularly.
However, there are several reasons why I believe that attendance should be required for university students.
First, attending classes allows students to fully engage in the learning process. In-person classes offer a level of interaction and discussion that cannot be replicated through online coursework. Students have the opportunity to ask questions, participate in group activities, and gain a deeper understanding of the material.
Second, attendance helps to create a sense of community and belonging within the university. By attending classes, students have the opportunity to meet and connect with their peers, which can lead to valuable friendships and support networks.
Third, attendance can improve academic performance. Research has shown that students who attend class regularly tend to have higher grades and a greater sense of accomplishment. This is likely due to the fact that attending class allows students to stay on track with the material and receive timely feedback from their professors.
In conclusion, while there are valid arguments for making attendance optional for university students, I believe that attendance should be required. Attending classes allows students to fully engage in the learning process, creates a sense of community, and can improve academic performance.
