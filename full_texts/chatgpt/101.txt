There are pros and cons to both options when it comes to deciding whether to have the university assign a student to share a dorm room with you or to choose your own roommate. Ultimately, the decision will depend on an individual's personal preferences and needs.
One advantage of having the university assign a student to share a dorm room with you is that it removes the stress and uncertainty of finding a compatible roommate. The university will typically consider factors such as academic interests, class schedules, and living habits when pairing students together, which can help ensure a smooth and harmonious living arrangement. In addition, having a roommate assigned by the university can be a great opportunity to meet new people and make new friends.
On the other hand, choosing your own roommate can allow for more control and flexibility in the living arrangement. You can select a friend or acquaintance that you already know and trust, which can help foster a more comfortable and familiar living environment. Additionally, choosing your own roommate allows you to have a say in the specific living arrangements, such as whether or not to have overnight guests or how to divide up household chores.
Ultimately, both options have their own benefits and drawbacks. It is important to carefully consider your own needs and preferences before deciding whether to have the university assign a student to share a dorm room with you or to choose your own roommate.
