It is a common belief that parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older teenage children, especially those between the ages of 15 to 18. However, I disagree with this statement.
First and foremost, it is important to recognize that teenage children at this age are transitioning from childhood to adulthood. They are beginning to gain more independence and responsibilities, and should be allowed to make their own decisions as they navigate this new phase of life. While it is important for parents and adult relatives to provide guidance and support, it is ultimately the teenager's life and they should be given the opportunity to make their own choices.
Furthermore, allowing teenagers to make their own decisions can help them develop critical thinking skills and responsibility. By being able to make decisions on their own, teenagers can learn to weigh the pros and cons of different options and understand the consequences of their actions. This can also help them develop independence and become more self-sufficient.
Additionally, it is important to consider the fact that teenagers at this age are old enough to understand the gravity of important decisions and the impact they may have on their future. For example, decisions related to education or career paths are significant and can have long-lasting consequences. It is important to allow teenagers to have a say in these types of decisions, as they are the ones who will be most affected by them.
In conclusion, while it is natural for parents and adult relatives to want to protect and guide their teenage children, it is important to recognize that teenagers at this age are transitioning to adulthood and should be given the opportunity to make their own important decisions. By doing so, teenagers can develop critical thinking skills, responsibility, and independence, and have a say in the decisions that will impact their future.
