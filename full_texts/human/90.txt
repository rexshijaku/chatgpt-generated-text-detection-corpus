Today almost everybody has a telephone and a computer, which is connected to the Internet. These inventions has some positive sides-especially when we should talk to a person who is a long distance away from us; nevertheless they have one negative side -they make communications between people less personal.
When I was a child neither we have a telephone, nor a computer connected to the Internet. Now we have both. However, I do not use them very much in order to communicate. I am not used to making a telephone call or sending e-mail yet. I would rather speak directly with the person I want to. In this way, I could see his or her reaction to what I say and thus it is easier to talk. Actually, this is the reason why people prefer to talk in person rather than using a telephone.
The other popular way to communicate is via sending e-mails. This, according to me, is the least personal way for communicating and the hardest way, as well. When we send an e-mail we sometimes either have not seen this person, or we do not know anything about him. Therefore, we cannot easily choose what to write him. Another thing that makes this kind of communication so impersonal is the e-mails, which are sent when we became members to an Internet site. These e-mails are sent to every member and text is the same.
All at all, e-mails and telephones make communications impersonal. Thus, for some people it is very difficult to communicate in this way. I hope that when further advancements of these technologies are made this problem will be solved.
