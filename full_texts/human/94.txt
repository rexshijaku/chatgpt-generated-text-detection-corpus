Some people prefer to live in places that have the same weather or climate all year long. Others like to live in areas where the weather changes several times a year. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.
I was born in a part of the world where the climate has four seasons and I learnt how much beauty each of these periods can bring to the environments and our lives. I prefer to live in an area where the weather changes several times a year.
Although sometimes I experience difficulties in the cold winters because of my bad tolerance to low temperatures, I cannot imagine the Christmas without the white snow making the whole world to look like the pictures from a fairy tale book. There is so much beauty that each season comes with that I do not think I can live in a place where the climate is the same all year long. I might like going in those places for some weeks in winter but not for a longer time. If I were to live in such a place for a life- time, I would miss the spring when the whole nature wakes up. I would miss all the wonderful spring colors, the new buds, the first grass that comes after the gray winter, the trees blooming, and the birds that are coming back from warmer places where they lived during winter.
The spring is my favorite season, but I love and know to cherish the others as well. Talking about colors, the fall is the next on my list, with all those reddish, yellowish and brownish hues that cover both the leaves and the earth. The ripe harvests, the crops waiting to be gathered are things that bring joy and satisfaction in fall.
The summer has its own beauty and in that period of the year the holiday flavor is in the air. In places with temperate climate the vegetation is abundant. The days are sunny and bright.
Living in a place with the same climate all year around would be very difficult, as I could not enjoy and cherish the wonderful things that occur every time a new season arrive.
