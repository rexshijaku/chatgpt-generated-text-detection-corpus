I prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day's work. First of all, my parents have helped me to develop the habit of getting up early in the morning since I was a kid. And I see this is a good habit because by getting up early, I have more hours in a day to finish the day's work. For example, when I get up early in the morning, I would reach the office earlier. Normally, I would either have more time to finish the work or finish the work earlier and leave home earlier.
Another reason that I prefer to get up early is because I can enjoy the beauty of the nature. When I get up early, I can really feel the cool weather and fresh air in the morning. And I would say it is best time of the day to plan for the day's work.
I also choice to get up early because I can beat the traffic jam at my residential area. In most cases, I can avoid the hectic traffics and reach my office on time by getting up early in the morning. By being in the office early, I show my commitment in my work and become more productive.
In short, I prefer to get up early and start the day's work early because it allows me to have more hours to work per day. Also, I can plan well in the cool and fresh environment. Last but not least, getting up early also means I can beat the traffic jam and be more productive in my work.
