Due to our society's rapid progress, a human being has been able to survive without communicating with other people. In the last few decades, various machines have been invented and spreader throughout the world. This sudden technological advance is the main perpetrator that made human beings extremely egoistic. Personally, I prefer to spend most of my time with my amicable, warm-hearted companions. In this essay, I will explain my opinion by offering several reasons.
My mom has always told me that intimate relationships with people are really important in one's life. A human being, in order to live a life without any regrets, needs another person to depend upon. It is a well-known maxim that every man has shortcomings. Through close friendships, a mortal experiences a variety of activities, and realizes one's shortcomings. At the same time, the person can make one's friend be aware of his/her faults. This mutual relationship will eventually result in mental development of two human beings.
An amiable relationship is not only beneficial for the realization of each other's shortcomings but also for their happiness. My friends and I often play soccer or basketball when we meet. These activities that we do together will be cherished as good lifetime's memory. Thus, a pleasant comradeship can be the main producer of pure joy.
Therefore, a companionship is wholesome in a lot of ways. First, we can become more advanced human beings through our mutual relationship. Second, we can receive mirth through the things that we collaborate on. I encourage all people to continue good relationships with their friends, because you will benefit from it in the long run.
