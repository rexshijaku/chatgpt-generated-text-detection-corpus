One reason for supporting the building of the new restaurant is that after the restaurant will be built; I will not have to spend a lot of time in order to go to a restaurant. Since my neghborhood is pretty far from the city's center I have to drive several hours until I find a good restaurant. The result is that I, as well as the other members of the neighborhood, go only to restaurants only in special occasions (for instance, in birthdates). When the restaurant will be built I will have the opportunity to go to restaurants more often, the way other people from other neighborhoods do.
In addition, the restaurant may offer work for the students who live in our neighborhood. If the restaurant will be successful, it will naturally need a lot of waiters. The students in my neighborhood, who need to work in a working place that allows flexible working hours, would love finding a job where they can earn some money. Therefore, if the restaurant will hire them as waiters, it might help them a lot. I can take myself as a good example: when I was a student I lived in another neighborhood where two restaurants were located. I used to work as a waiter in one of these restaurants, earning money for the university's tuition fees.
In conclusion, I strongly support building the new restaurants in our neighborhood. The restaurant will allow me (as well as to the other neighbors) to eat in a restaurant more often. The new restaurant might also offer job opportunities to the students of the neighborhood.
