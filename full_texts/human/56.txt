I strongly believe that people should never judge a person by external appearances. The way we look not always reflects the way we are. We can make huge mistakes if we let the external appearances tell us everything about someone.
I consider that outward qualities are related in some ways to the manner we are and the way we feel inside. Sometimes the clothes we chose express our mood, how we are feeling at that moment. Also, the hairstyle, make up and many other aspects of our look sometimes give an idea of our attitude towards life. Even though, not all aspects or, for some people, any aspect of the personality is shown in external appearances. The look is not evident enough to communicate deep feelings, beliefs, thoughts and behaviors. There is so much more inside of a person that can only be noticed after knowing him very well.
I have met people who give an erroneous first impression. At first sight one could describe them in a completely different way from what they turn to be when you get to know them well. Before making premature conclusions we should pay attention at many other features, such as the way the person talks, the words he uses, the look in his eyes that help us to recognize how is that person like. Peopleâ€™s values, educational background, skills and virtues lie in the inside, not in the outside.
There is a great risk of missing good friends if we allow us to judge by appearances. We always should give a second chance to people to show us how they really are, without masquerades. We have to be smart to not mistake what we see on the surface, because the main part of almost everything is hidden and not easily seen.
