In our world there are many different customs that differ from one country to another. My country has one that, in my opinion, can be adopted by many other countries. My country inhabitants called it "Martisor". In spring, people give each other a gift of a white and red piece of string, which means revival of the environment.
One of my reasons is that this custom is symbol of life and health. In our competitive world, when we often forget to enjoy the simplest things in our life such as flowers, trees, fresh air, walking with friends and family, or in other words have a good time, "Martisor" is not a simple gift. Our life is very complicated and stressful. Therefore, in my opinion, this custom will benefit to all people all over the world.
Another important reason is that one can make a lot of friends by giving them his inexpensive gift. Also, he can make it by himself because it is very easy to make and you do not need special acknowledge how to make it. For example, I feel very happy when somebody gives me such a gift. This is not because I like surprises. When somebody give you a gift, this means he is proud of you, he love you, or even he want to make you happy, to see your smile or a look in your eyes.
In conclusion, I can say that if I had an opportunity to choose one custom, I would select "Martisor" because everybody can make a lot of friends enjoying life and having a good time by giving them this symbol of life and health.
