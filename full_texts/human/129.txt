I disagree that reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies. Of course I know the advantage of reading fictions. For example, I can bring my favorite book in the train to read during commuting or traveling. Also, it is a good idea to read novels to kill my time when taking a boring lecture. I can soon go into the world in the book and enjoy seeking what happens next with a lot of imagination alone. People often say that reading books develop children's creativity and I agree that. However, I enjoy watching movies more than reading something for the following reasons.
First of all, it is easy to have a fun with movies. Even if we don't watch a movie from the start, we will know soon what is going on in the story. Screens where characters act through a camera make audience pay attention easily because of the visual scenes and sound. The mixture of clear, beautiful or horrible pictures and its matched sounds have great effect on audience so that they will not forget the scenes.
Second, if you like a character in a movie, you can be excited in not only the flow of the story but also keeping watching the person. Moreover, I would like to get items characters in films use and imitate their fashions; we can get a lot of hints and ideas, which make our daily lives more comfortable and enjoyable.
Watching one movie with friends is also a happy time. After watching it, we will chat about the stories, characters and what each of us felt. We talk and listen to them and give our own judgment. We can do such a thing because we can watch movies with more that two people at the same time, on the other hand, reading books tend to enjoy alone.
Thus, I prefer watching movies to reading fictions. Through movies, especially which we can see at movie theaters now, we can have a lively conversation and get to know today's popularity.
