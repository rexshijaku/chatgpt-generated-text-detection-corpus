If I had the chance to travel back in time to meet a famous person from history, I would like to meet German scientist Albert Einstein, because I consider him being the best physicist of all times and an extraordinary intellectual. He made a valuable contribution to humanity.
Born in German in 1870’s, Einstein became the most famous scientist of the twentieth century. His studies revolutionized and reshaped scientific thinking. I find interesting the complexity of his mind and spirit. He was in conflict with his deep religious feelings, he said that the Bible could not be literally true, and these thoughts also allowed Einstein to discard scientific prejudices. He stated that problems couldn’t be solved at the same level of awareness that created them. His creativity amazes me, after Einstein’s work, space and time would never again be the same.
Not only his scientific work is fascinating to me, but also his sense of humor, just to give an example of that I will tell that he once said that gravitation cannot be held responsible for people falling in love. He was an undoubted revolutionary, an innovator and also a philosopher and a pacifist. He believed that he owed his success to imagination, that fantasy had meant more to him than the talent for absorbing knowledge. I totally agree with him about that. Since I am interested in science I admire him very much for his great contribution to humanity, I would have been pleased to meet him and work with the genius and emblematic Master of Science that he was.
To conclude I say that I would choose to meet Einstein who is acknowledged as the greatest physicist that ever lived because I have always found fascinating his reasoning and the significant contribution to science he had made.
