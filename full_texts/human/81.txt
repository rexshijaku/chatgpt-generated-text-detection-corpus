If it is decided to build a statue or monument to honor a famous person in my country, I would choose Mahatma Gandhi- the father of our nation. Though there are many other personalities who have contributed to the country and will be a part of the unforgettable glorious past of our country, but Mahatma Gandhi's contribution to his country and fellowmen is irreplaceable.
Mahatma Gandhi was a person who made it possible to achieve independence from British rule. He believed in the principle of non-violence, which he followed throughout his life till he breathed his last. Due to his realistic approach, our country was able to free itself from the shackles of injustice and slavery.
Mahatma Gandhi was an advocate by profession but he spent his entire life for his country and lived a most simple and disciplined life. He invented the spinning wheel, which was meant to teach the people of the country a means of producing their own cloth for wearing instead of relying upon the foreign goods. The superior example of his simplicity and determination to achieve anything in life is an inspiration for the generations to come.
In conclusion, Mahatma Gandhi in my opinion truly deserves the respect of people and also the title given to him as the father of the Nation. Any monument/statue in his memory can prove to be a mark of respect for the great personality.
