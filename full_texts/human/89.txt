Discovery of natural gas provided power plant and company energy to produce goods to export. Thus, we could save the money to spend to run plants. Therefore the price of production was lowed.
Second, the exploitation of natural gas supplied us with diverse another natural resources. The natural gas layer implies the possibility of oil buried beneath it. Of course, our country is investigating in the continental of shelf in our sea.
Finally, we are independent of the change of the energy resources in price. Most people had to be careful the rise of oil in the past. It was essential for Government to comprehend the supply of energy. Furthermore, company took pains to compensate for the rise of cost during production.
In conclusion, the discovery of natural gas gave rise to a lot of changes. It is needless to worry about the rising cost. And we can improve the competitive power in world markets. Through the exploiting of oil, we will need not to export energy resource any more.
