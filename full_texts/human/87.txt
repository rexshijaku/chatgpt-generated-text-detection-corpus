A country is represented by her people. She will be revered or belittled by the way her people behave. If I had a chance to suggest a place to a foreign visitor to visit in my country, I am glad and proud to suggest "The Banyan", a non-profit organization in Chennai, India.
The very first reason to suggest a place like this instead of stunning, scenic beautiful natural places is that everywhere in this world, we can relax ourselves by visiting a naturally beautiful, peaceful place. But "The Banyan" is a place where mentally ill disputed, forsaken women get shelter.
The reason why I was very much impressed by "The Banyan" is, It is the perfect rehabilitation center, found by two college girls Vandhana and Vaishnavi without any strong political as well as economical background but with their strong fire for helping people. After facing number of problems, they established this organization. Now this organization has hundreds of members.
When I first visited "The Banyan" I was really melted. I saw women who were not even aware of their name. I saw small kids affected by AIDS, but still playing cheerfully with out knowing about the danger they are facing. When I was speaking with one of the women, she said, " I feel very comfortable here. With the help of The Banyan I have the confidant that, in the near future, rejoin with my near and dear ones from whom I was separated for the reason that I have forgotten already. "
If the visitor sees this organization, he can realize that our country has such a bold and helping minded people like these girls. These girls are the best persons to represent my country. I am really very proud to suggest this place to a new visitor.
