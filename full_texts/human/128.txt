The older generation today always complains that the youth are unmotivated and directionless, they lack focus and the future is going down because of these behaviors. Nonetheless, youth are the product of its upbringing and the representation of its time. Thus, what they are and what they know will certainly be different from those of the older generation. Therefore, to say that the youngsters are useless is not only wrong as they can also contribute in their own way and teach the older generation a lesson or two.
As we all know, today's technology moves very fast. With our daily responsibility, it is almost impossible for us to keep up with every little new gadget that comes out everyday. With young people, its different, new things interest them. Furthermore, being young they absorb new knowledge like a sponge. Thus, they can help us in getting in tune with new technologies. Young kids, for example, can probably teach their grandparents to use the computers, which in turn, will also be good for their relationships.
In addition to that, by looking at the young, we can learn about the society better. As I've mentioned earlier, youngsters represent their time, hence, by understanding them, we can understand the needs of the society, as this group of age is the most outspoken. A good example would be the hippie movement in the 60s. The movement displayed their dissatisfaction with the system and the need for more freedom of expression.
As someone once said, "Life is a learning experience", thus, from that, we can deduce that there is no full stop to the process of learning. Therefore, instead of being critical and cynical, maybe we can try to understand the youth better by learning from each other. After all, they are the future.
