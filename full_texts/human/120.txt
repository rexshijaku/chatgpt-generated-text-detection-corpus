I believe that life is a river, every destination with a unique purpose. Change is but a minor part of life and whatever the change, mine would be for the better.
People vary and that is why you often find various approaches to life. For those who are content with the direction their life is heading, the idea of change would probably send shivers through them. This is due to the fact that they are at a point where they are satisfied with the way they have maximized their God given potential that is a positive reason for dreading change.
Others dread change due to the fact that they are too scared to try or adapt to new experiences. Taking into consideration that we are all human, fear to try is a normal feeling. The only disadvantage is the fact that unless you try, you never know what you could have accomplished or how well and capable you are to move on. No chances to discover the courage you have within to accept defeat but never stop trying. This is a negative reason for dreading change.
Habits can be addictive and so the main question here is whether they are positive beneficial habits or negative ones. By that I mean that the choice is all up to the individual. If the change is from the negative to the positive, then there is no reason whatsoever that should make one dread change Doing right is never wrong.
In conclusion, change can either mould you or break you. I would rather try and change for the better than life my life knowing that I never tried. Within every human being, there is a hidden potential that only change can help maximize. The question however is, whether we will give change a chance. It is all up to you, the individual!
