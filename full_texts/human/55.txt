Some people may think that money is the most important aspect of a job. Of course, this factor cannot be ignored. But in my opinion, I disapprove this kind of idea. As I see it, there are many other important aspects a job, rather than money.
One of them is the satisfaction of the worker. No matter what other people say, if the person is satisfied with his/her work, that's it. For example, my father was a good student in high school. His parents and teachers told him to go to law school because it was the best career a person could have at that time and was an honor for the family. But my father disagreed and went to the army because he wanted to. And until now, he is very satisfied with his job. He didn't choose a job that was conspicuous to other people, but a job he liked.
Another factor is how well the job suits the person. We can't get a clumsy person to be a doctor that requires great awareness on the work, such as surgery. A single mistake, even the slightest failure can kill a person. So people should also consider on how well he/she can do the job, and if it's suiting the person.
In closing, I disagree with the idea of money being the most important aspect of a job. Of course, we can't totally ignore money. Usually many people just work, whether they like it or not, just to earn money. But we must keep in mind that money should be considered as a second, after we decide things such as the satisfaction or how well the job suits the person. Money isn't everything in life, remember that.
