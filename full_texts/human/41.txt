With the help of technology, students can learn more information and that too more quickly. This is absolutely correct. I would like to support my answer with some reasons.
First, technological learning is more interactive in its learning process than just sitting and reading a book or just listening to a lecture. For example the learning by the means of Computer technology is very interactive, today, and hence the growth is simultaneous.
Second, using such kind of techniques, mind actually grows more and the person becomes an intellectual person with the passage of time.
Third, the traditional methods of learning like lectures given by teachers or notes given in books. Do not let the student become independent rather the student becomes more dependent due to the spoon-feeding being done to it.
Fourth, the technological advances in different fields definitely give a lot of exposure to those who were earlier naive in this field of Technology.
Lastly, human mind is such that it has the capacity to absorb more data if things are taught to him practically. Like if there is a model of an Electric Iron shown in the Book, which is explained by the teacher and the students are made to understand the working. The other way could be this that the children are shown a real Electric Iron as a model and then the working of its different parts is being explained. Definitely the grasping power will be more in the latter case. Therefore, in the end I would like to conclude my essay by saying that with the passage of time the demands and the necessities of the Time are changing too. So are the changes in the studentâ€™s mental level and the methods of teaching. Technological methods undoubtedly score higher than the traditional ones.
