Some people prefer using machines to do work while others choose to work with their own hands. Personally, I prefer the latter because I find that working with one's hands will reap a greater sense of satisfaction when the task has been completed. Consider a case. Your friend's birthday is coming up. It would be absolutely fabulous if you could send her a gift personally, right up her doorstep instead of sending her an electronic greeting card with the computer in your bedroom. Doing things with your own hands brings allows us to appreciate the fruits of labor and hard work.
The virtual world is far too distant and unrealistic. Human touch is still the most sincere way to make friends and communicate with your loved ones. Moreover, an over reliance on machines will tend to make us less capable in completing simple task. Taking a short ten minute walk to the shop opposite your house to buy some daily necessities will benefit our health because it allows us to exercise our limbs after lying on a couch in front of the television for over two hours but majority of the people nowadays will choose to drive there instead, claiming that it saves time and strength. Human's natural ability to move and do work has depleted over the years with the invention of machines which enable us not to even move ourselves to get things done. It would benefit and foster family relationships by doing things together such as cleaning the house or clearing the garden with your siblings instead of ordering the maid-"a human machine" around or following a schedule to take turns to clean up the mess using a vacuum cleaner in less than half an hour.
Nevertheless, machines does indeed provide us with a much more efficient and faster way to complete a task in hand like typing a resume or an essay instead of writing it out. It does allow us to survive better in a fast-paced society.
