It is true that some universities require student to take classes in many subjects and other universities require students to specialize in one subject. In my opinion both of this approaches have advantages and disadvantages. In the present essay I will argue in favor of requirement student to take classes in many subjects.
It is great for one to know what exactly want to do in his life. If one can answer the question "What vocation is appropriate for me" than he can attend university that require students to specialize in one subject. This is the right way to improve knowledge and to make the most of courses.
But unfortunately there are a few people knowing well what exactly they are born to do. I am one of them. That is why I think taking classes in many subject would help student to make his mind in order to realize his vocational opportunities. Moreover, taking classes in many subjects helps one to increase his knowledge and to achieve new levels of it.
Of course it is a free choice to attend many classes or to specialize in one subject. But I rather attend university that requires students to take classes in many subjects. Because I am still incapable of making my mind which particular subject to choose, and because it is really important for one to know a lot of things, not only in the realm of his interests, but out of their borders.
