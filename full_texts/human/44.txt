In my opinion an important skill that a person should learn in order to be successful in today's world is to keep him updated in every field. It is said that knowledge is power. Keeping oneself updated in this high speed, changing world is very important. Knowledge is like a small drop in this vast ocean and there is no end for it. The more knowledge you gain, the more you need.
One of the advantages of keeping oneself aware is that nobody can mislead you in anyway. For example if you know the price of a car, you want to buy, would help you negotiate more rather than just agree to the dealers price. Keeping ourselves updated also boosts our confidence and also keeps us ahead in this competitive world.
We should develop this skill by listening to news, reading articles, learning new technologies. In short we should always keep on increasing our knowledge. If we do this then rest of the thing like wealth, fame, comforts will automatically come to us. Hence keeping yourself updated is very important skill everybody should acquire in today's world.
