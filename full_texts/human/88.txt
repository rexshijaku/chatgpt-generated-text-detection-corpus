If time travel were possible, I would certainly want to go back to the year that I graduated high school. This time was filled with excitement, carelessness, and hope for the future.
The prospect of graduating high school and becoming one of the elite was definitely a magical period of time. Most of my high school classes were complete and preparations were being made for the prom. My friends and I though we could conquer the world. All of the responsibilities of adulthood certainly lay in our future.
After graduation, that carefree summer was filled with amusement. Daily trips to the beach and hanging out with friends at different bars at night, made me wish this time would never end. My buddies and I often talked about our plans for college and how easy life would be once we graduated with a degree. There would be time enough to deal with life's problems later on.
Looking towards the future probably wasn't the best thing to do at the time. Stepping back and enjoying the present would have made more sense. If only I knew then what I know now, with age comes wisdom and with memories comes nostalgia.
Finally, that marvelous age of transition from youth to adulthood would be the period I would most like to return to. Show me the way to the time machine!
