Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. I disagree with this point of view for several reasons, which I will detail in this essay.
There are two reasons that support this view. The first reason is that all the creatures on the face of the earth have the same right to exist, be it a four-legged animal or a human, both have the same right--just because humans have more so-called intelligence than do animals doesn't necessarily mean that they are naturally entitled to use any land as they wish.
The second reason is that for the existence of humans on earth, the existence of other creatures is essential. I say this because the presence of all the animals is essential to maintain natural order. We have seen the consequences of upsetting this balance in many environmental problems such as global warming.
Furthermore, animals are a necessary part of our lives on Earth. For example consider the food chain of the rat, snake, and eagle. We know that certain types of eagles are endangered species. If the eagle is hunted to the point where it becomes non-existent, then the food chain will be broken. As a result of this, the number of snakes will increase. This will result in greater environmental problems and could harm the lives of humans.
If the endangered animals are not protected the existence of humans will be in danger. Our history has shown that if we continue to exploit our resources, particularly by destroying the land and therefore the natural habitat of plants and animals, we will ultimately harm ourselves. Therefore, I believe it is vital for people to preserve land in its natural state.
