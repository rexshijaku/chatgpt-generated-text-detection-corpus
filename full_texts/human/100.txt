If I was asked to send one thing that represents my country, I will choose an object that holds a great amount of importance. The product that I select should be native to my own nation so that I can inform my nation's excellence to the people of the world. In this essay, I will describe the attire that I will offer in great detail.
In my native country, there is a traditional garment called "Hanbok". Its vivid color and intricate, ingenious design will evoke people's applause.
The reason that I would choose "Hanbok" is that its pattern is unique and innovative. The main difference between "Hanbok" and regular western dress is that the former is extremely practical, while the latter is not. It is suitable for any kinds of meetings, so you don't have to squander you money in purchasing luxurious dresses.
Due to its extraordinary design, "Hanbok" can adapt to any kind of circumstances. In the summer, "Hanbok" will lower your body temperature, because it is full of minute holes. In the winter, "Hanbok" will maintain your body temperature, so that you wouldn't have to worry about getting cold.
"Hanbok" consists of several picturesque (charming) colors; green, red, yellow, and blue. The colors symbolize my nation's patience and creativity. Hence, presenting "Hanbok" in an international fair will result in my country's success.
I have explained my opinion through the ensamples that I have enumerated above. "Hanbok" is the perfect product to display in an international expo, because it represents our national traits.
