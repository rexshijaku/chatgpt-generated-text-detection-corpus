It may sound strange but my personal approach to learning things is a combination of learning by doing, by reading about things and listening to people talking about them. I consider that using all three ways (when given the opportunity) is the best way to gather as much information as possible about the respective thing.
Sometimes I do not have at hand all three ways of learning so I use whatever is best applicable for that specific case. If, for example, I have to learn about a theoretical subject that I need to use at my work, first I read all available bibliography on that theme, then I try to listen to other peopleâ€™s opinion on that matter. Combining the two methods, I compare my understanding and possible questions regarding that theme with others comments and approach.
Another case would be when I have to learn a practical thing like playing squash. In this situation the most preferred way to learn is by doing. I would probably ask a trainer to show me how to play. After getting acquainted with the movements I may listen to others talking about their way of playing, in this way trying to use their tips and tricks of becoming a better player.
A case, in which I would combine all three ways mentioned above, is if I have to learn how to use software. Firstly I read instructions and documentation that comes with the software, and then I try to apply what I read. If I have difficulties getting the program to work properly, I ask people with more experience in the matter to show me how to do it, which means I learn by doing. This would also be the case when I learn by listening how others have used the software, what problems they encountered and what solutions they found.
As described above, I consider the best way to learn things is to combine all the methods available for a certain situation and use all information at hand to make the most out the learning process.
