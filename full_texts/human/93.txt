If I could ask a famous person one question, it would definitely be regarding the meaning of life to him/her. The meaning of life has long puzzled even the greatest of minds. In my opinion, knowing the meaning of life and what one wants out of life can actually help a person to live out a fairly productive life.
Life represents different things to various people. Some people view life as mesmerizing and worth living, while others just take it for granted and don't really give it much thought. Knowing what life is really about is of great importance to me. I have always been amazed at the multitude of living beings that presently inhabit the earth. What is the meaning of life? How did it come about in the first place? What can be done to make living here on earth worthwhile? Someone who is famous might actually have some interesting thoughts to share on this subject.
It surprises me that no one ever asks such questions from famous people. People like to interview a famous person and ask all sorts of personal questions. I think that asking this single question and carefully observing the speaker can actually reveal a lot about the speaker's personality and outlook than asking personal questions. This is because famous people might become somewhat defensive and not entirely honest when asked to describe their personality traits or likes/dislikes. But asking them about their outlook about life gives them space to talk about a lot more than just answering some to-the-point questions.
Asking a famous person about his/her view about life might also help us out in how we can view the world around us. Often people who become famous or successful have positive outlook towards present and future. They don't worry about the hardships of the past. This might motivate others to adopt a similar positive view of life.
In short, I would really like to ask a famous person about his/her outlook on life, which in effect, will let me know something about the famous person as well.
