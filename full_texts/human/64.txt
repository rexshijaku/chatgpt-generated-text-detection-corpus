As a friendly and open-minded person, I enjoy making friends. As a result, I have many friends. However, regardless of their background, gender and characteristics, I notice that all of my close friends have one characteristic in common - they all have a sense of humor.
First of all, I always wanted to feel happy and have a good time when I go out with friends. By going out with friends who are humorous often make me laugh and cheer me up whenever I feeling down.
In addition, I believe people who have a sense of humor, are normally the one who has positive thinking. I like to mix with people with positive thinking because I always believe that it is better think positive rather than negative when dealing with problem. For example, when I face a problem, I like to talk to friends who humorous and positive because they can always give me new ideas and help me to solve problem by guiding me to look at problem from the different perspective.
In short, what I want the most in a friend is a sense of humor. Friend who has a sense of humor can influence me positively.
