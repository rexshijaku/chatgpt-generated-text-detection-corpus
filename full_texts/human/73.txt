In order to earn a living many people are engaged in jobs. Some jobs are high paying with long hours of work while others are low in salary but the working period is also less. Now if I were given a choice to choose between these options then I would certainly choose the latter one.
Man is born free but he is in chains. He has various duties to perform. He must earn bread for his family. But in doing so he must not be devoted to his work so much that he has little time stored for his family and friends. Because there are times when he should give some time for his family. To strengthen the family ties, it is essential.
Now a day the society has gone to astray because there is no family value. Parents are busy with their work. Children do not find their parents most of the time. So they are with their friends most of the time and if they choose wrong friends then they are likely to go down the drain. But if parents are beside them at their time of need, then they wonâ€™t feel lonely. Parent-children relation will grow.
Money is essential but it is not the only thing we should run after. If a friend is in need, we should be by his side. If a relative is ill, we should manage some time to see him. And most of all if our family needs us, we should put aside all jobs and be there. We cannot escape from our duties by just saying that we are too busy in our work. We should keep our priorities in order.
Finally, it can be said that we earn money for our happiness and for the comfort of our family. In doing so we should not forget our ultimate goal. If we do, then our families will be in a disaster. In our difficult times we will have no friends to share our problems with. So we should get jobs considering the consequences it may bring. If a lower-paying job with shorter hours makes me happy in the long run, then it is the one I certainly will choose.
