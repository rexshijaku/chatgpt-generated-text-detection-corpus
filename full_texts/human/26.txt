My hometown, Pentair Remiss, is a small fishing village located in west Malaysia. You can hardly find a shopping center there in the neighborhood. I, together with most of the residents in this town, would definitely most welcome the proposal of building a large shopping center in our neighborhood.
Nearly one half of the residents in my neighborhood have to seek for a job in big city like Kuala Lumpur or Singapore. This is because most of the youngsters in my village are reluctant to follow their ancestors’ step to become a fisherman. They wish to pursue a better job in the city. By building a big shopping center, it will surely bring up a lot of working opportunities for the community. Some can work as executives while others can work as salesperson in the shopping center.
Other than that, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the community a more comfortable and more convenient place to shop. As the weather in Malaysia is so hot, it will be an ideal spot to go shopping for its air-conditioning environment compared to the small stuffy grocery store down the town. On the other hand, it is much more convenient to shop in large shopping center where you can get nearly most of the goods here, from veggies to undergarments, just name it.
Furthermore, the shopping center will most probably benefit the community by offering goods in better price. The shopping center will eventually exist as a main competitor to the other grocery stores and sundry shops in town. Therefore, every store will try to win their customers by lowering the price and at the same time offering better services. And the customer will certainly be the winner in this ‘pricing war’.
In a conclusion, I fully advocate the idea of building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to this small town.
