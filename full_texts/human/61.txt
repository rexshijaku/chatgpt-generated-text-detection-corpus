I think I would prefer to hurry to get things done than to take my time and live life at a slower pace because it allows me to do things over a short period of time, make my self available for opportunities and it makes one to be efficient in life.
Firstly, life on earth is short and I would advise anyone who cares to listen that it is advisable to do things on time knowing fully well that you cannot live forever and that people around you should feel your impact. Imagine if everyone takes their time to do every thing that they should do, things wouldn't be done on time, there would be chaos, anarchy and total disorder. For example, the police would fight crime when they feel like or the president of a country would address urgent humanitarian needs at his own time or children would go to school when they feel like. Such a situation would lead to the total breakdown of a society.
If I have to do things at my time, then I would miss a lot of opportunities in life. For example, if an unemployed graduate like myself spends the whole day doing chores in the house, when I could do the house chores quickly and attend seminars related to my field that could keep me updated on recent developments in my field and in the long run enhance my job prospects.
Imagine if workers in a company take their time to do things at a slower pace, then such an organization is bound to fail because things wouldn't be done on time and such a company would lag behind its competitors.
No matter what some people feel I think is better for people to do things in a hurry to prevent disaster, promote efficiency and make one available for opportunities?
