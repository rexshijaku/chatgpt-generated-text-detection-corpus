If given a choice of working for someone else or being self-employed I would choose the latter without any hesitation. This doesn't mean that working for someone else is in any way inferior to being one's own boss. I believe your personality type and the way you want to live your life are the key factors in making this choice.
To me a life without thrills and adventures looks unattractive. The myriad challenges and problems one has to face as a self-employed or businessperson attracts me more than the relatively secure life of an employee.
I am well aware of the darker sides of my choice. Being your own boss gives you immense freedom. You are free from undertaking any venture in which you cannot put your heart, nor will you be troubled by the stumbling blocks of employer disapproval in the course you believe in. But hand in hand with this great freedom comes great responsibility too. The success of the entire venture or business lies solely upon you, the decision you make the methods you use to implement them etc. The risk factor is very high and you have to be prepared to fight against all the destructive, malicious, sudden rising storms. But the joy you will get from leading a life in your own terms, is worth all the strife. For success tastes sweetest after the toughest battle.
To conclude I choose the adventurous life of a self-employed or businessperson to the smug secure life of an employee, I choose to live a life in my own terms, to shine in use and not to rust.
