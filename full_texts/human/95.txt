Most of the students might have lived with roommates while studying in school or university. In most of the cases, it is true when the students went to the universities. I would prefer to have the characteristics of the roommates are co-operative, competitive and generous.
The one important quality of the good roommate is the generous, as the student stay most of the time with the roommate; he should be kind enough to share our sorrows and happiness. For instance, during my study in university once I felt sick before annual examinations. My roommate was taken me to the doctor and paid lot of attention till it gets cured. With out his kind, generous nature I would hasnâ€™t recovered before the exams and I would have got low grade.
Also roommate should be competitive. This is because this will increase our studies growth a little bit faster and always try for the highest grade in the exams. At the same time we should not depress by looking at the roommate's progress in the exams. Infect, we should take that progress as a challenge and keep trying for the good grade. For example, I always used to take inspiration from my roommate percentage and used to get the more or less equal percentage with him. This resulted in increasing my position in class from top10 to top5 ranks.
Co-operation also one of the important quality of the good roommate. This would eventually helpful in sharing the knowledge of the subject and also resources like reference books and writing material. In my study days, once I couldn't attend the classes for one week due to ill. But as I have got my roommate such a cooperative person, I got to know the course details went on during that week and that was helped me a lot in follow up with the next courses.
As a whole from my point of view important qualities of good roommate are generous, competitive and co-operative
