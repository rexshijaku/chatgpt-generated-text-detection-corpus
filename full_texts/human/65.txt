One time when I was in Europe I saw this message in a gift store “Today problems will be the best experiences in the future”. I do agree with this idea. Although most experiences in our lives seem difficult, after overcome problems that these experiences involved, they become valuable lessons for the future.
Difficult experiences demand people to be strong. In my own experience, for instance, I lived one of the most difficult situation that a human being can live, which is to lose the most valuable person: the mother. Because I lost my mother when I was seven years old, I learned how to be responsible and take care of myself, and now I am an independent and strong person who can face any difficulty for severe that seemed.
On the other hand, sometimes, difficult situations offer challenges that can change one’s life. For example, five years ago I won a scholarship to study a Master degree, and in compensation for this grant I was asked to do some work for the University where I was studying. They proposed me to be a teacher. Although I felt fearful and unconfident at the beginning, I accepted that challenge and I became to be an excellent teacher.
Finally, after overcome difficult situations people are able to handle any problem in a better way because they are already familiar dealing with unpleasant experiences. My own case illustrates it. After loosing my mother and being a teacher without previous experience, I have developed skills like control of stress and work under pressure that has allowed me to face any problem o challenge.
In conclusion, people complain about having difficult experiences, but after all, they understand how living these situations in one of the better way to learn valuable lessons that will help them all their lives.
