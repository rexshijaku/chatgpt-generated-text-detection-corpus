If I could meet a famous entertainer, it would be Mr. Steve Harvey. He is a good comedian and a sober actor. He speaks very good English and he always gives lessons to the audience.
Mr. Steve Harvey is a comedian. He makes the people laugh. Watching his shows makes the audience tension-free. This would have a soothing effect on our hearts and brains. For instance, if somebody has a heart disease, he can feel good by laughing which watching his shows can do. Also some angry people can reduce their anger by watching his shows.
He is a very sober actor. It means that he never appreciates vulgarity. We can watch his shows with our family and enjoy them. Now days, children are getting spoiled by watching TV. This is because TV encourages vulgarity.
Secondly, he speaks very good English. A foreigner can learn American accent by watching his shows. We can improve our vocabulary simply by enjoying simultaneously. And itâ€™s very good for language learning children.
Lastly he gives lessons in his shows, which are inspiring both for adults as well as children. Instead of watching some talk shows, parents can make their kids watch Steve Harvey show.
So it would be very inspiring to meet such a person who is a versatile actor.
