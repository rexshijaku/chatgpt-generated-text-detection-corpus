Modern life has become so demanding nowadays that everyone is facing the problem of stress. In order to escape the stress due to work pressure people try out different ways to become stress free. These include reading, gardening, cycling, playing and many more things as per their choice. For me the best ways to escape stress are listening to music of your choice, going on a short trip and spending time with family. The reasons for the above choices are mentioned below.
Firstly, listening to good music is the best way to escape from stress as because it takes us into a different world. While listening to the sweetly composed tunes it makes us forget all the worldly worries. Also we can listen to music anywhere using portable systems. This helps us in avoiding stress whenever we feel so. Therefore I think listening music is an excellent way to avoid stress.
Secondly, going on a short trip refreshes us and helps us to escape stress. Whenever we go for such trips we just leave aside our daily routine and just try to relax. We enjoy doing things out of the daily schedule. So this change simply lifts our spirits and helps us to escape stress.
Also whenever we spent time with our family, we talk our heart out to our loved ones, listen to their sweet thoughts and play like a child with the young ones. All these helps us releasing all our thoughts, which create, stress and make us young and fresh at heart.
In conclusion, I would like to say again that listening to music, going for a trip and spending time with family certainly releases stress as supported by the above-mentioned points.
