In everyone's life, there is some influence of other person, either they are parents or friends. In my opinion, friends are the most important influence on young adults. I will explain this by giving some examples as below.
In the early age of person, there is more influence by family. But as soon as becoming the younger, they come more contact to friends rather then family. Younger people like the company of their age with whom they can share their ideas, thoughts, life etc. With some good friends, one can develop itself taking examples from the good friends. Friends can exchange their good thoughts, developing careers, and some good and bad things with friends also. Some talks are like that one cannot share it with family but can share with friends.
Secondly, friends play an important role in our lives. They are the most important people who can change one's path by giving them right decision or right advice or may spoil the life by giving the wrong advice. Its all depends on type and nature of friends. If we have good friends, who can understand and knowledgeable person, they are always helpful to us. In the contrary, if friends are not good, then in their friendship, one can spoil his/her life also. I would like to give example here, how friends can more influence on young adults. When I was studying in the collage, there is one group, in which some boys are good and some are not good. Some boys are on the wrong track. I mean to say that they have habit of smoking, drinking etc. In that group, some boys are really nice, but after some time they also started smoking and drinking. Which is not good for the health. This makes impact on young adults.
In sum up, I would like to say that friends are the most important influence on young adults, rather then family because of above reasons
