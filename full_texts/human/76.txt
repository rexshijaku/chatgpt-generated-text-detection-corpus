Traveling is one of the best ways to enjoy ourselves. Many people like to travel and see different places. Some people travel alone and discover new places. Other people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide. Because I like meeting new people and like to learn as much as possible about the places I visit, I would prefer to travel with a group of people led by a tour guide. In this essay, I will explain my reasons.
First of all, by traveling in a group, we can benefit from the travel knowledge of our tour guide and our traveling companions and from the language skills of our tour guide. Without knowledge of the language, we might have great difficulty in communication. Also we should search for the places that we are going to visit in order to not to waste time. Because most of us are not professional tour guides, we cannot know all the important places that have to be visited. Tour guides can help us in different situations. So, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is better than traveling alone. Many tour guides know at least two foreign languages, so they help us to communicate when we have trouble. Tour guides also give us information about the places that we visit, so the trip becomes even more informative.
Secondly, meeting new people can be very interesting when we travel in a group. We can build friendships that last forever. For example, two years ago, with my cousin, I went to Paris with on a tour with a group. There were almost thirty people in our group. We got along with each other very well. We went to restaurants all together, and it was really fun. If the number of people in a tour increases then, the transportation and hostelling costs decrease, and people can visit more places with less money.
In conclusion, I can say that traveling in a group of people is the best way to travel. Traveling in a group allows us to save money, make good friends, have companionship, and learn important information about the place that we are visiting.
