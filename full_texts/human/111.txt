I think that, if people move to another country, they had better follow custom of the new country and feel them as part of society where they study, work and live.
First of all, people following custom of the new country show respects to people in that country and the way they live. From other side, people of new country also will respect newcomers and help them, what is very important to whom, who are beginning a new life in the new country. If newcomers will feel themselves foreigners and keep distance between them and people from new country, they never will have either success in career or comfort in life. Our nation has one wise folklore, what means "If you going to drink water in new country you should follow their custom and tradition". I found it very useful from my own experience of being the Russian, the Chinese and the American, while remaining just Mongolian, where I had lived. Everywhere I meet very nice people who are ready to help and make my life in their country as happy as in my motherland.
Secondly, following their custom, they can learn new things, gain more knowledge and make their lives more interesting. I know 19 years old American volunteer teacher who came in my country to teach English. After living two years in new country he fully adapted and became a member of new family. Everybody respected him and loved. He learned a new language, a new style of life and achieved useful experiences of which the most important is the belief in himself that other people need him and he can make good things. I believe that he will make good career, find god friend live happy life, wherever he is.
Finally people moving to another country must follow new custom because it is not only respect to peoples in new country but also respect to themselves in living happy life in new country, while keeping their own custom within family, country mates and friends
