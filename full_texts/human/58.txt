There are many ways that a company can help the society as a whole. For example, it can support the arts or it can take some action to protect the environment. I believe that the protection of the environment should be a priority to all businesses.
First of all nowadays we live in several times more polluted environment than our ancestors. And life conditions are getting worse every day. I think that companies can do a lot of things about that. They can even raise their profits helping the society. Recently, I read in a newspaper about a complaint of McDonalds to plant trees in order to prevent further destruction of the ozone layer. They received approval from the society and increased their profits. So that companies can follow them and help to save our environment.
Secondly, I think that protecting the environment, the company helps every single member of the society. I have in mind all the deceases that have occurred during the last sentury. These, so called "new era" deceases, like all allergies, are due to the polluted air. Many companies can make an effort and use special equipment in their product ional process in order to restrict the air pollution.
In conclusion, I think that the company is better to give some money to protect the environment, because in this way it will benefit the whole society. It will contribute to people's health and less polluted environment.
