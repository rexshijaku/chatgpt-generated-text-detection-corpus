Of course, many times a companion looking up the travel, especially when the companion is a loved friend or generous parents. One of the most important things in my life is have friends and to be in your companion. So, travel with my friends, parents and any other important person is excellent.
But sometimes, we need be alone. We like to be alone when we need thinking about problems or on the next step in a live project. Maybe was better divide these problems and projects with other persons, to have a partner, but is hard to say something’s and we prefer keep these things for ourselves. In this situation is a pretty good idea to travel alone. The contact with a different place, different language, be in a place which you never was before do the ideas flow and, many times, we resolve our problems or decide what way will be follow.

Don’t matter if you go alone or with companion, the important is all that you learn and fun in your travels around the world.
