There are some people who have a large group of friends while others prefer spending time only with a couple of their close friends. Both these attitudes have their advantages and disadvantages. I will analyze both cases and present my views in favor of having a few close friends.
When a person spends time with several people it helps him share his ideas with and collect information from various different sources. It broadens his horizons and makes him aware of different points of view on any subject. It also makes him socially more active and as is commonly said, "Man is supposed to be a social animal".
On the other hand being with a couple of close friends helps a people achieve a level of intimacy not possible in a large group. They develop a bond between them that is hard to break. Such people share an understanding, which leads to high levels of loyalty. It leads to a kind of friendship that can be depended on in any kind of situation. Such friends are truly loyal and would never shrink back from supporting each other.
I personally prefer spending time with my close friends, who happen to be just one or two. They are the friends I am absolutely comfortable with. In school I had just two good friends who I am very close to. I can share any thought of mine with them. Very often they understand my feelings without me having to state them explicitly. In college I have a large number of friends, and though I can discuss a variety of subjects with them, I do not share the level of intimacy with them that I share with my school friends.
Due to these reasons, I prefer having a couple of close friends. They are the friends I can always trust, those I can turn to whenever a situation becomes unmanageable. I am absolutely sure, that even if my college friends refuse to help me, my school friends will never turn me down.
