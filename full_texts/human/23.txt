I have been working for 6 months in a dental clinic. This time allowed me to meet in different ways my co-workers. I’m working with many kinds of people and I am spending a lot of time with them everyday. And now, I know a little bit about them. In my opinion some characteristics of a co-worker are help everybody in the office, good communication, Responsibility and create a good work's atmosphere.
Helping each other’s is really interesting because you will finish fast. When I’m in the office, my partner Rachel brings me help and we both finish in less time I think that without her help, I probably spend hours. You can make more tasks in less period of time when somebody brings you help. Helping is a good way to meet people. When you work with other people is like a team. Things won't work well if you don't share your abilities with the people around you in the office. Everybody is important to make an excellent work.
Being responsible is the best characteristic of a co-worker because it means that you really care about your job and your working environment. Being responsible is demonstrated dedication and respect for others. Therefore, everybody will have an excellent impression if you are responsible with your work.
In addition, when you are working you want to have a good relation with everybody in the office. Avoid talk bad or critic ate about somebody else from the office. I don’t like to work somebody who is bossy or always in a bad mood. If my coworker knows something else, it is good to share knowledge. I always have good attitude and open mind to learn new things. I love to work with nice people. That makes me feel in excellent mood and always available to enjoy my job.
For all these reasons some characteristics of my coworker are: Responsibility, Nice and kind with everybody. Available to help.
