One of the ways of entertainment for the people in this time that we live in is going to the theatre and watching a movie. Some movies are serious, designed to make audience think the others are designed primarily to entertain and amuse. I 'm fan of the movies and watch both types of movies but to tell you the truth I enjoy more those with that entertain. Why? I explain it.
Our lives are very dynamic; we compete with others about our jobs and other stuff we are always in the run. That's why, when I sit down to enjoy a movie, I want to be relaxed. Especially, for me are good the comedies in which I can laugh until I get tears in my eyes. Laughter is good for us and we all need that. And that can get it in a good movie [comedy0) like "Liar, Liar".
On the other hand, movies that are more serious and make us think, we have to be very concentrated to follow the happenings, and sometimes can make us sad or have bad influence on us. When I was watching the movie "a shot through the heart " which theme was the war in Bosnia, it make me sad and I felt anger in the same time against enemy.
All in all, I conclude that I prefer more the movies, which are destined to entertain, because all I need is to relax and have fun that we all need.
