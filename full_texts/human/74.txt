I personally agree that grades encourage students to learn. Grades enable a person to enhance his\her ability.
Grades enable a person to assess his capacities and disabilities. By looking at one's grade one can roughly tell how well one knows his subject. And this enables a person to overcome his flaws and improve his knowledge on the subject he is weak in.
Grades increase a sense of competitiveness. We usually work hard to get more marks then our friends and classmates. Grades provide a base and reason for this sense of competitiveness. If there were no grades people wouldn’t bother much about enhancing their knowledge and would take their studies easy.
Grades tend to develop an interest towards studies. In today’s world where most of the students consider studying a burden, a bad grade in their subjects would initiate them to do better. This would enhance their knowledge.
Grades either good or bad are beneficial to students. If one gets a bad grade, he would be embarrassed and would thrive to work hard thereby improving his scores and knowledge. And if a person gets good grades he would be careful not to reduce his grades. Thus either way grades play an important role in a student’s life.
Thus grades are beneficial and are necessary to encourage students to learn.
