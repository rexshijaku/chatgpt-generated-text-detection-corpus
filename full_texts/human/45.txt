There are various sports and activities that people can get involved in. Some people are attracted to dangerous sports or other dangerous activities such as mountain climbing, car racing and high speed skiing to mention but a few, for a variety of reasons
For some, it is a challenge to be overcome or won. An example is a lady driver joining the rally. For example in Kenya, we have an annual Safari rally, which involves cars racing with an aim of finishing with best points. The terrain is usually very varied and rough and men dominate the sport. Recently, there have been entries by women, and some may participate to prove that women can also undertake the challenge and it should not be seen as a man's race.
Other sportsmen and women may find these dangerous activities to be actually fun. For some mountain climbers for example, the goal is not only to reach the peak but also to enjoy the varying scenario, plants and animals as they ascend the mountain.
To others still, the attraction could be the prize to be won in participating in such a dangerous sport. An example is in bullfights where the player dangles a red cloth in front of a bull, not only irritating it but also inciting the animal to charge. If the player wins defeats the bull, he is allowed to kill and probably earn some money.
In conclusion therefore, there are varying reasons that attract some people to dangerous sports, ranging from the personal to monitory satisfaction.
