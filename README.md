# ChatGPT Generated Text Detection Corpus

Hello! And thank you for being here!

In this repository you may find the following:

 ``Human`` and ``ChatGPT`` written essays on the given ``126`` different topics. These essays are located in their respective folders inside the main folder of the application.


``Human essays`` were extracted automatically from [this](https://englishclubmskh.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/toefl-essays.pdf) PDF which is a collection of TOEFL essays.

``ChatGPT essays`` were retrieved automatically from the ChatGPT Api using [this](https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT) client.

It's worth mentioning that, as a meta-data point, each line in each file corresponds to a paragraph of that essay, and the file name for each essay aligns with the question number.

Furthermore, you may find the ``126 asked questions`` in [this](https://github.com/rexshijaku/chatgpt-generated-text-detection-corpus/blob/main/full_texts/questions.txt) file.

This dataset was used in our work ``ChatGPT Generated Text Detection`` which is published [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/366898047_ChatGPT_Generated_Text_Detection).
